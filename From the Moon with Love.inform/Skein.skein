From the Moon with Love
An Interactive Fiction by Matthew Shimura
Release 1 / Serial number 130304 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Bathroom
A spotless tiled restroom with many stalls and a large spanning mirror along the wall. It seems very peaceful here, but you smell a stong odor in the air of cleaning chemicals. In the back of the room you see a utility closet that looks to be used by the Janitor.

The exit to the bathroom is to the East.

Loading Zone
 A platform at the top of the metal tower. This platform is hundreds of feet in the air, and below you can seen the space base. From up here everything looks so small and the people below look like ants.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Panel which looks like it controls all the tubes and wires that go to the Rocket as well as the Docking Mechanism.

The Loading Zone also has a elevator to which looks like it can bring you back down to the launch pad. The Space Shuttle is East of the Loading Zone.

Crew Compartment
You step inside the Space Shuttle to the Crew Compartment the place where spend most of your time living and working on your voyage. You can see your way through the metal room with the fluroscent lights illuminating your way. You now stand on one of the walls of the space shuttle, as it is now pointed upwards towards the atomsphere, and will change orientation when reaching the correct altitude.

In the Crew Compartment you spot some Beds, a Work Bench, and some storage Cabinets. Below you in the Space Shuttle is the Lower Deck, and Above you is the Flight Deck.

Loading Zone
 A platform at the top of the metal tower. This platform is hundreds of feet in the air, and below you can seen the space base. From up here everything looks so small and the people below look like ants.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Panel which looks like it controls all the tubes and wires that go to the Rocket as well as the docking mechanism.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back down. The Space Shuttle is East of the Loading Zone.

You can see an Air Lock here.

Training Room
In the training room you see a giant spinning Centrifuge used to test the tolerance of Astronauts to acceleration for the conditions of space. Mastering the Centrifuge is a required of an astronaut that might take a few times to do correctly.

As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a refuelling station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the Side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

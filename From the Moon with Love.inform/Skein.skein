From the Moon with Love
An Interactive Fiction by Matthew Shimura
Release 1 / Serial number 130308 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Bathroom
A spotless tiled restroom with many stalls and a large spanning mirror along the wall. It seems very peaceful here, but you smell a stong odor in the air of cleaning chemicals. In the back of the room you see a utility closet that looks to be used by the Janitor.

The exit to the Bathroom is to the East.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Pane which looks like it controls all the rocket&apos;s fuel tubes as well as the launch mecanism.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back down.

As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a refuelling station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the Side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Elevator is to the East.

This Loading Zone also has a elevator to which looks like it can bring you back down to the launch pad. The Space Shuttle is West of the Loading Zone.

You step inside the Space Shuttle to the Crew Compartment the place where spend most of your time living and working on your voyage.

You now stand on one of the walls of the space shuttle, as it is now pointed upwards towards the atomsphere and will change orientation when reaching the correct altitude.

In the Crew Compartment you spot some Beds, a Work Bench, the Airlock Control, and some Storage Cabinets. Below you in the Space Shuttle is the Lower Deck, and Above you is the Flight Deck.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refuelling Station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the Side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Elevator is to the West.

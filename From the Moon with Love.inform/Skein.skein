Bathroom
A spotless tiled restroom with many stalls and a large spanning mirror along the wall. It seems very peaceful here. In the back of the room you see a utility closet that looks to be used by the Janitor.

The exit to the Bathroom is to the East.

  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  We have liftoff…

 You suddenly feel the thrusters engage and the rocket starts to blast off with an ear shattering roar. The rocket starts to move faster and faster, and it feels like the skin on your face is being pulled back because of the force. As the ship rattles you hear a voice over the loudspeaker. &quot;Detaching Rockets&quot;
 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space.
 
Flight Deck
At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see three seats, one for the captain, one for the engineer, and one for you although you are the only one on the mission.

In front of the seats is a thick Windsceen the protects you from outer space and allows you to see out the front so you can pilot the ship and use the Controls to the space shuttle.

Crew Compartment
You step inside the Space Shuttle to the Crew Compartment the place where spend most of your time living and working on your voyage. You can see your way through the metal room with the fluroscent lights illuminating your way. You now stand on one of the walls of the space shuttle, as there is no gravity.

In the Crew Compartment you spot some Beds, a Work Bench, and some storage Cabinets. Below you in the Space Shuttle is the Lower Deck, and Above you is the Flight Deck.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refuelling Station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs are to the West.

Loading Zone
 A platform at the top of the metal tower. This platform is hundreds of feet in the air, and below you can seen the space base. From up here everything looks so small and the people below look like ants.

Across a large gap you see the rocket, but you cannont get to it yet.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Pane which looks like it controls all the rocket&apos;s fuel tubes as well as the launch mecanism.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back down. 

You can see an Air Lock here.

 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space.

At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see three seats, one for the captain, one for the engineer, and one for you.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the air conditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense proportions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refueling Station that looks like it could be used to fuel up the rocket. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs going up the tower are to the West and Mission Control is to the North.

 A platform at the top of the metal tower. This platform is hundreds of feet in the air, and below you can seen the space base. From up here everything looks so small and the people below look like ants.

Across a large gap you see the rocket, but you cannot get to it yet.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Pane which looks like it controls all the rocket&apos;s fuel tubes as well as the Launch Mechanism.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back down. 

You can see an Air Lock here.

  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  We have liftoff…

 You suddenly feel the thrusters engage and the rocket starts to blast off with an ear shattering roar. The rocket starts to move faster and faster, and it feels like the skin on your face is being pulled back because of the force. As the ship rattles you hear a voice over the loudspeaker. &quot;Detaching Rockets&quot;
 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space.
 
Flight Deck
At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see three seats, one for the captain, one for the engineer, and one for you although you are the only one on the mission.

In front of the seats is a thick Windscreen the protects you from outer space and allows you to see out the front so you can pilot the ship and use the Controls to the space shuttle.

 You put the flag of the motherland in the hole and claim the Moon FOR RUSSIA!!! 

 Now that your mission is complete you radio back to mission control. &quot;Thank you for your service to the Country. Your sacrifice will be remembered,&quot; says mission control over the radio.

 Remembered? I&apos;m not dead yet.

 Suddenly, you have a hard time breathing, your oxygen supply seems to be depleting. BOOM! the space shuttle explodes behind you.

 In your last moments, you finally remember the mission details. 

 To go to the moon and plant Russia&apos;s flag. After completing your mission, your life will then be terminated as your use has ended…

As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refuelling Station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs are to the West.

Across a large gap you see the rocket, but you cannont get to it yet.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Pane which looks like it controls all the rocket&apos;s fuel tubes as well as the launch mecanism.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back down.

 Now that the rocket is fueled and you are ready to go you are ready to launch. You put your space suit on and walk slowly to the rocket. The Airlock unlocks with a hiss of hydraulics and you step inside. You go up to the flight deck, and strap into your seat and get ready to launch.
  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  We have liftoff...
 You suddenly feel the thrusters engage and the rocket starts to blast off with an ear shattering roar. The rocket starts to move faster and faster, and it feels like the skin on your face is being pulled back because of the force. As the ship rattles you hear a voice over the loudspeaker. &quot;Detaching Rockets&quot;
 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space
 
Flight Deck
At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see three seats, one for the captain, one for the engineer, and one for you.

In front of the seats is a thick Windsceen the protects you from outer space and allows you to see out the front so you can see out of the ship, and the Controls to the space shuttles.

Storage Room
A small room filled with Space Suits and Space Helmets hung on the wall behind a Cage.

There look to be two exits one to the North, and one to the East.

You can see a partition and a Cage (closed) here.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refuelling Station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs are to the West.

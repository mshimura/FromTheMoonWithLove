An Interactive Fiction by Matthew Shimura

Bathroom
A spotless tiled restroom with many stalls and a large spanning mirror along the wall. It seems very peaceful here. In the back of the room you see a Utility Closet that looks to be used by the Janitor.

The exit to the Bathroom is to the East.

Training Room
In the training room you see a giant spinning Centrifuge in the middle of the room. Getting in the Centrifuge is a requirement of an astronaut to complete their training.

The bathroom is to the West, and the storage room is to the South.

  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  We have liftoff…

 You suddenly feel the thrusters engage and the rocket starts to blast off with an ear shattering roar. The rocket starts to move faster and faster, and it feels like the skin on your face is being pulled back because of the force. As the ship rattles you hear a voice over the loudspeaker. &quot;Detaching Rockets&quot;
 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space.
 
Flight Deck
At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see one seat for you since you are the only one on the Mission.

In front of the seats is a thick Windscreen the protects you from outer space and allows you to see out the front so you can pilot the ship and use the Controls to the space shuttle.

Below the Flight Deck is the Crew Compartment.

Mission Control
A gigantic room filled with rows of monitors, each one manned by an Engineer or Scientist. In the front of the room is a large screen constantly updating with news from all over the world and the status of the mission. In the corner you spot a trash can.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the air conditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense proportions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refueling Station that looks like it could be used to fuel up the rocket. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the air conditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense proportions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refueling Station that looks like it could be used to fuel up the rocket. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs going up the tower are to the West and Mission Control is to the North.

There look to be two exits one to the North, and one to the East.

You can see a hatch here.

Mission Control
A gigantic room filled with rows of monitors, each one manned by an Engineer or Scientist. In the front of the room is a large screen constantly updating with news from all over the world and the status of the mission. In the corner you spot a Trash Can.

At the front of the room looks to be Greg the Head Scientist, to the west is the Storage room, and to the South is the Launch Pad.

As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the air conditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense proportions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refueling Station that looks like it could be used to fuel up the rocket. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs going up the tower are to the West and Mission Control is to the North.

In the training room you see a giant spinning Centrifuge in the middle of the room.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refuelling Station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs are to the West.

Across a large gap you see the rocket, but you cannont get to it yet.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Pane which looks like it controls all the rocket&apos;s fuel tubes as well as the launch mecanism.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back down. 

You can see a Control Pane and an Air Lock here.

 Now that the rocket is fueled and you are ready to go you are ready to launch. You put your space suit on and walk slowly to the rocket. The Airlock unlocks with a hiss of hydraulics and you step inside. You go up to the flight deck, and strap into your seat and get ready to launch.
  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  We have liftoff...
 You suddenly feel the thrusters engage and the rocket starts to blast off with an ear shattering roar. The rocket starts to move faster and faster, and it feels like the skin on your face is being pulled back because of the force. As the ship rattles you hear a voice over the loudspeaker. &quot;Detaching Rockets&quot;
 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space
 
Flight Deck
At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see three seats, one for the captain, one for the engineer, and one for you.

In front of the seats is a thick Windsceen the protects you from outer space and allows you to see out the front so you can see out of the ship, and the Controls to the space shuttles.

You wake up groggily from a hangover, and find yourself sitting on a toilet. All you can remember is that you are in the command center for a space program on Earth. Not remembering who you are, what your purpose is, or why you are here, confuses you greatly. You must find out…


From the Moon with Love
An Interactive Fiction by Matthew Shimura
Release 1 / Serial number 130318 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Bathroom
A spotless tiled restroom with many stalls and a large spanning mirror along the wall. It seems very peaceful here. In the back of the room you see a Utility Closet that looks to be used by the Janitor.

The exit to the Bathroom is to the East.

Training Room
In the training room you see a giant spinning Centrifuge in the middle of the room.

Getting in the Centrifuge is a tequired of an astronaut, and might take a few times to do correctly.

The bathroom is to the West, and the storage room is to the South.

You can see a partition here.

Launch Pad
As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the airconditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense propotions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refuelling Station that looks like it could be used to fill up the rocket. Connected to the rocket is a metal tower with a Elevator which looks like it could be used to get to the Loading zone. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

The Stairs are to the West.

 A platform at the top of the metal tower. This platform is hundreds of feet in the air, and below you can seen the space base. From up here everything looks so small and the people below look like ants.

Across a large gap you see the rocket, but you cannont get to it yet.

Up here at the Loading Zone you can see a Control Pane which looks like it controls all the rocket&apos;s fuel tubes as well as the launch mecanism.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back down. 

You can see a Control Pane and an Air Lock here.

 Now that the rocket is fueled and you are ready to go you are ready to launch. You put your space suit on and walk slowly to the rocket. The Airlock unlocks with a hiss of hydraulics and you step inside. You go up to the flight deck, and strap into your seat and get ready to launch.
  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  We have liftoff...
 You suddenly feel the thrusters engage and the rocket starts to blast off with an ear shattering roar. The rocket starts to move faster and faster, and it feels like the skin on your face is being pulled back because of the force. As the ship rattles you hear a voice over the loudspeaker. &quot;Detaching Rockets&quot;
 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space
 
Flight Deck
At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see three seats, one for the captain, one for the engineer, and one for you.

In front of the seats is a thick Windsceen the protects you from outer space and allows you to see out the front so you can see out of the ship, and the Controls to the space shuttles.

Loading Zone
 A platform at the top of the metal tower. This platform is hundreds of feet in the air, and below you can see the space base. From up here everything looks so small and the people below look like ants. Across a large gap, you see the rocket, but you cannot get to it yet.

Up here at the Loading Zone, you can see a Control Pane that looks like it controls all the rocket&apos;s fuel tubes and contains the Launching Lever.

To get back to the Launch Pad use the stairs to go back Down.

  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  We have liftoff…

 You suddenly feel the thrusters engage and the rocket starts to blast off with an ear-shattering roar. The rocket starts to move faster and faster, and it feels like the skin on your face is being pulled back because of the force. As the ship rattles, you hear a voice over the loudspeaker. &quot;Detaching Rockets&quot;

 The shuttle detaches from the rocket, and you have finally reached space.
 
Flight Deck
At the head of the Space Shuttle is the flight deck where the entirety of the ship is controlled. You see one seat for you, since you are the only one on the Mission.

In front of the Flight Deck is a thick Windscreen that protects you from outer space and allows you to see out the front so you can pilot the ship. You also see the controls.

Below the Flight Deck is the Crew Compartment.

As you open the doors from mission control to go outside, you leave the air conditioned building behind. In the distance you see a giant Rocket of immense proportions. It&apos;s reflective surface glint beams of sunlight through the air.

Around the launch pad you spot a Refueling Station that looks like it could be used to fuel up the rocket. Running up the side of the metal tower is a Fuel Tube.

Crew Compartment
You step inside the Space Shuttle to the Crew Compartment the place where spend most of your time living and working on your voyage. You can see your way through the metal room with the fluorescent lights illuminating your way. You now stand on one of the walls of the space shuttle, as there is no gravity.

In the Crew Compartment you spot some Beds, a Work Bench, and some storage Cabinets. Below you in the Space Shuttle is the Lower Deck, and Above you is the Flight Deck.
